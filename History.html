		<p class="text">Have you ever thought about how the Rubik’s cube was created? To many, the mechanism of a cube is a confusing thing to look at. It has changed a lot since it was first released. Here, we will be exploring the creation of the Rubik’s cube.</p>
		<p class="text">The first Rubik’s cube was invented by Erno Rubik in 1974. The first prototype was made of wood and had only a single coloured sticker on the centre tile of each face.</p>

		<p class="text">Erno Rubik did not know how to solve it when it was first invented. It took him a month to figure out the solution for the puzzle. In 1977, the first Rubik’s cubes (which were known as &ldquo;magic cubes&rdquo;) were sold and distributed in Hungary by Politechnika.</p>

		<p class="text">In 1979, the toy was taken to a toy fair. A license was signed by Tom Kremer for the &ldquo;magic cube&rdquo; to allow it to be distributed in any country. The Ideal Toy Company took on the distribution and renamed the &ldquo;magic cube&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Rubik’s cube&rdquo;. It was internationally launched in 1980. Since then, 350 million Rubik’s cubes have been sold.</p>

		<p class="text">Nowadays, Rubik’s cubes can be bought both online and in-store. The traditional Rubik’s brand Rubik’s cube is commonly bought in-store (although it can be found online) while speedcubes are typically only found online.</p>
